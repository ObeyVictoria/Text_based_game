ABOUT CULINARY TEXT-BASED-GAME
    It is played by one player, it is used to test if the player knows the recipe for a particular food or snacks
a player is allowed to choose what type of food/snacks he or she wishes to prepare,but before the player can get
access to the kitchen store, the player has to get at least 3 ingredients correct for making what he/she wants to prepare 
to avoid wastage of resources.
As a player gets an ingredient right he/she scores one point otherwise zero is awarded.

Dos and Don't of the GAME
1. A player can only pick from the list of food/snacks given.
2. A player is not allowed to repeat an ingredient otherwise zero score is awarded.

HOW TO PLAY

step 2: Click the exit button to take you to the game screen.
step 3: Enter your game name as required.
step 4: Type what you wish to prepare, food or snacks.

***ISSUE I NEED HELP WITH
    I wanted to avoid repitition of code by appending the list of recipe together but it was not possible because
each snack/food has different ingredients even there are some similar ingredients.
Please is there anyway to make the code shorter and provide the same result, that'll check for correct ingredients 
seperately.
